Yet another blog, really? Will this blog become a place for in depth analysis, or a graveyard of failed passion this time around? Since this is a public facing blog, I felt that I should write my thoughts for why I've created this 'yet another blog.'

This one is different, I swear. I'm not putting any expectations on what this one will become. I've had blogs that I felt were necessary to explore my thoughts for myself, and blogs that I felt were necessary because I had something to say. This blog, I'm coming into it giving myself more freedom. I'm coming into it just to tell my story, whatever that may be.

There's a lot going on in the world right now. And with that, I've always used writing as a creative outlet to work through the thoughts in my head. Sometimes what I write isn't even related to the thoughts, though. Sometimes I just need to write. And still then there are times when I don't need to write at all. There are times where I write because I want something to do, and others when I write because I feel like I have something to say. And of course, it always helps to flex my web dev skills a bit. This blog is for all of the above. I don't want it to fit in any one niche.

I've tried blogs before where I try to make them specific to a topic. I wanted readers who would want to continue to come back. I wanted to build something that could provide value. I wanted to build something that had meaning to the reader, however, I had it backwards. Isn't the purest form of a blog one where the author can write something that has meaning to them?

I read a series called Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint recently. It is a series about a reader who is thrust into the novel that defined his life as he grew up. I won't get into the specifics of the stories, but it made me redefine how I view fiction and writing as a whole. Oftentimes when creating content, or writing a story, the typical advice is to know your audience. When you know your audience, you can tailor your story to the wants and needs of that audience.

With Omniscient Reader, a recurring theme is that a story means something different to everyone who experiences it. A story will be different for the author, and it will be different for each reader. So rather than tailor your story for the wants and needs of a reader, you just write the story. And if the story means something to the reader, then that is who the story is for.

And that's a message that I've taken with my writing. When I write, I don't want to change my story. I want to write the story I have, and if it means something to just one reader, then this story is for them. The story isn't written with any meaning intended, it is written for the reader to extract their own meaning. The words are how you interpret them. And if those words mean something to you, then those words have been written for you, even if you are just one reader.

This blog is for just that one reader.

That is why I write.
