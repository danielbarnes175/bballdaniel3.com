There's always a new blog, isn't there? For me, I mean. I always have some fancy new website or idea, or some random project that I'll never complete. That's just the way I handle things.

And I don't quite think it's a good thing. Is it a bad thing, though? It might be. It might not be. Is abandoning something when the satisfaction no longer pulls you through it justified? Does one have an obligation to themselves to see something through when they've started it?

I don't know.

I do know, however, that this will be yet another website of mine. It's yet another project. It's yet another blog. So, I felt that, if I were to have a public facing blog, I should write my thoughts for why I've created this 'yet another blog.'

There's a lot going on in the world right now. And with that, I've always used writing as a creative outlet to work through the thoughts in my head. Sometimes what I write isn't even related to the thoughts, though. Sometimes I just need to write. And still then there are times when I don't need to write at all. There are times where I write because I want something to do, and others when I write because I feel like I have something to say.

I've tried blogs before where I try to make them specific to a topic. I wanted readers who would want to continue to come back. I wanted to build something that could provide value. I wanted to build something that had meaning.

I recently read a series called Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. It is a series about a reader who is thrust into the novel that defined his life as he grew up. I won't get into the specifics of the stories, but it made me redefine how I view fiction and writing as a whole. Oftentimes when creating content, or writing a story, the typical advice is to know your audience. When you know your audience, you can tailor your story to the wants and needs of that audience.

With Omniscient Reader, a recurring theme is that a story means something different to everyone who experiences it. A story will be different for the author, and it will be different for each reader. So rather than tailor your story for the wants and needs of a reader, you just write the story. And if the story means something to the reader, then that is who the story is for.

And that's a message that I've taken with my writing. When I write, I don't want to change my story. I want to write the story I have, and if it means something to just one reader, then this story is for them. 

So this blog won't have a specific topic. I can't even promise that all the posts will be coherent, nor that the posts will be consistent. All I can say is that I will write my story, all for that one reader.

Thanks,
