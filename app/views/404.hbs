            Since you ended up here, let's make it worthwhile! Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for understanding how people learn, developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues. It's structured as a pyramid where learning progresses from basic recall to creative application.

                <h4 class="mb-3">üß† Remembering</h4>
                <p>The foundation stage where you absorb basic facts and information. <em>"What is this thing?"</em> You memorize and recognize key concepts without deep understanding yet.</p>
            </div>

                <h4 class="mb-3">üí° Understanding</h4>
                <p>You begin to grasp the <em>"why"</em> behind the facts. <em>"Do X because of Y."</em> You can explain concepts in your own words and see connections.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-3">‚öôÔ∏è Applying</h4>
                <p>You use your knowledge to solve problems in new situations. <em>"Do X because of Y, since it worked in situation Z."</em> Knowledge becomes practical.</p>
